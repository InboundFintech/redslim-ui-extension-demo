# Redslim UI Extension Demo

This is a demo frontend for the Redslim UI Extension, built to showcase how HubSpot UI Extensions can integrate with our middleware to provide dynamic proposal generation for Redslimâ€™s data service offerings.

---

## Overview

This project is a React-based single-page application bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It simulates a CPQ-like interface where users input parameters such as data volume, service level, and subscription duration, and then receive a calculated proposal with pricing and deliverables.

The frontend currently uses mocked calculation logic for demonstration purposes, with plans to integrate real backend middleware APIs from the [Inbound Fintech Middleware](https://github.com/InboundFintech/ift-middleware) once access is granted.
